        <p className='intro'>This project was for my Google UX Design Course. The title was "Design a trailer browsing app for a movie theater". 
            I completed this project over the course of 4 weeks, designing and prototyping the mobile app, and I learned about how biases affect our decision making and 
            the steps we must take to avoid them.
