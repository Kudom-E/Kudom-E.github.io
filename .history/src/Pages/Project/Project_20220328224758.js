            <p className='sub'>UX Research | UX  Design | Prototypes | 2021</p>
            <p className='intro'>This project was for my Google UX Design Course. The title was "Design a trailer browsing app for a movie theater". 
                I completed this project over the course of 4 weeks, designing and prototyping the mobile app, and I learned about how biases affect our decision making and 
                the steps we must take to avoid them.

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The project was my first in the UX Design Course, and
                I selected this from the list of others because as a fan
                of movies in general, it had me curious. The apps I knew
                of showed movies in general and did not specialize in 
                just movie trailers. Then creating the problem of some
                movie lovers having difficulty in finding movie trailers
                so they could know what movies are to be released.</p>

                <h2>Why a Trailer Browsing App?</h2>
                <p>This is a mobile application that allows users to view movie trailers 
                easily and comfortably on their mobile phones. The initial thinking 
                was to make it easy for movie lovers like myself to find movie trailers 
                easily and have access to viewing them on their phones. so the goal
                was to design an app for movie theatres; allowing users to browse
                movie trailers for a movie theatre so users are made aware of the
                movies that would be showing.</p>
