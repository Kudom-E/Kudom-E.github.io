    summary: `Having identified scheduling issues during my attendance at the movie 
      event featuring six premieres in a single day, my focus has been on 
      driving the automation of the scheduling process for 
      the movie event and creating an efficient system. With a limited number of cinema 
      rooms available, the challenge was to schedule the six movies within 
      the four sessions for each cinema room. The complexity was further 
      addressed by analyzing customer movement by noting the movies they 
      would choose to watch and the cinema rooms that would be showing them 
      at specific times. This ensured an optimal schedule regardless of the 
      selected sequence of four movies. This project not only 
      streamlined the scheduling logistics for the event but also enhanced 
      the overall customer experience by strategically organizing cinema 
      sessions and minimizing room changes, ultimately reducing crowding by 
      80% and creating a seamless and enjoyable movie-watching experience 
      for their customers.`,

    event in 2023, themed 'The Evolution of Pharmacy Practice: Innovation and 
    Capacity-Building.' As the developer hired for this project, my 
    goal was to create a seamless digital experience that not only reflected 
    the dynamic evolution of the symposium but also encouraged registration. 
    The app offered a sleek and user-friendly interface, 
    providing users with access to insightful content on plans for the event,
    updates and resources, and answers to questions. This was an exciting project 
    converting 95% of users into participants who registered, therefore 
    contributing massively to the success of the symposium.`,
